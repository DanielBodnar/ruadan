How recording works:

  Session:
    A container for events. Each event (or collection of events) is sent with a sessionId param.
    A session is a single recording. All the events in a session will be replayed together.
    A session can also be associated with a userId and apiKey, which should be provided
    in the recorder's constructor (not implemented yet).
    Use cases:
      1. Record a user's entire interaction with the application. Done by calling
         startRecording without forceNewSession. The recorder will try to continue
         a previous existing session until the session is manually stopped (endSession)
         or the session expires. This will result in a single replay.
         A session may expire if no events are received for some time (not implemented yet).
         When a session expires a new session should start automatically when user interaction
         is detected (not implemented yet).

      2. Record a single activity. Done by manually calling startRecording with forceNewSession
         at the beginning of the activity and stopRecording at the end. It is possible to record
         several activities at the same time for different windows (not implemented yet) or
         continue an activity across several windows (not implemented yet). A session can still
         expire after some time with no interactions (not implemented yet).

    Notes: We may need a flag that says if we should start a new session after the previous one
           expired or just stop recording until we receive another startRecording call.

  Window (not implemented yet):
    Represents a window/tab. Each event (or collection of events) is sent with a windowId param.
    Each window also has a special "focus" event that lets us know that the user is viewing that
    page (not implemented yet). It is unclear how to maintain the windowId for the same window
    between pages and request a new windowId for a new window. Windows should be able to receive
    a sessionId from the windows that opened them (to maintain an activity across windows, but
    still allow several activities at once for different window groups).

  Page:
    Pages are represented by a "newPage" event. It is handled in the same way as other events
    with the difference that it may reset the NodeMap when it contains a full page snapshot.
